A Father's Message to the Future: Why I Built This
My child once asked me, "Why don't we have luxury cars and a big house? Why do we live like a bank employee's family?"

Hearing that was difficult for a father. But I know your future will be built on and within this digital world of blockchain.

To my daughter, Hanna, and to her entire generation:

If you see me consumed by this virtual world of code and concepts, know that this message is for you. I am doing this to show you that some things must be done transparently, out in the open.

I don't care if many people play this game or not. I have designed it to be open-source because the world is full of self-interested actors, but this is a mechanism for visible justice.

Every participant can verify the other participants and see the true winner for themselves. My hope is that one day, justice, blockchain, and artificial intelligence can work in harmony. Perhaps this project is just a glimpse—a single picture—of the kindness and fairness these three forces can create when they are aligned.
