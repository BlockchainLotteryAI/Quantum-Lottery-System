# A Father's Message to the Future: Why I Built This

> "The true value of a project is not measured in its profitability, but in the integrity it contributes to the world."

## The Question

My child once asked me:
> "Why don't we have luxury cars and a big house? Why do we live like the family of a bank employee?"

Hearing this was heavy for a father. But I know your future will be built on and within the digital world of blockchain.

## The Dedication

**To my daughter, Hanna, and to all her generation:**

If you see me consumed by this virtual world of code and concepts, know that this message is for you. I am doing this to show you that some things must be done transparently, out in the open.

## The Manifesto

I don't care if people play this game a lot or not. I have designed it as open-source because the world is full of self-interested actors, but this is a mechanism for **visible justice**.

Every participant can verify the other participants and see the true winner for themselves.

My hope is that one day, **Justice**, **Blockchain**, and **Artificial Intelligence** can work in harmony. Perhaps this project is but a glimpse—a single image—of the kindness and fairness these three forces can create when aligned.
