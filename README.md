A revolutionary, provably-fair lottery system powered by Quantum Entanglement principles and Blockchain technology.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Provably Fair:** Leveraging quantum randomness for truly unpredictable results.
*   **Fully Transparent:** Every draw and transaction is recorded on the blockchain for public verification.
*   **Decentralized:** Operates via smart contracts, eliminating central points of failure and control.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning for draw analysis, anomaly detection, and pattern monitoring.
