      "the_question": "My child once asked me, 'Why don't we have luxury cars and a big house? Why do we live like the family of a bank employee?'",
      "the_weight": "Hearing this was heavy for a father. But I know your future will be built on and within this digital world of blockchain.",
      "the_dedication": "To my daughter, Hanna, and to all her generation:",
      "the_explanation": "If you see me consumed by this virtual world of code and concepts, know that this message is for you. I am doing this to show you that some things must be done transparently, out in the open.",
      "the_core": "I don't care if people play this game a lot or not. I have designed it as open-source because the world is full of self-interested actors, but this is a mechanism for visible justice.",
      "the_vision": "Every participant can verify the other participants and see the true winner for themselves. My hope is that one day, justice, blockchain, and artificial intelligence can work in harmony. Perhaps this project is but a glimpse—a single image—of the kindness and fairness these three forces can create when aligned."
